In the current business landscape, the demand for efficiently handling substantial data volumes at rapid speeds, coupled with the need for quick scalability to support modern web applications across diverse industries, is prevalent. NoSQL databases have gained popularity in this era dominated by cloud computing, big data, and mobile and web applications due to their capability to deliver high performance and scalability, making them a preferred choice for many companies.

They support multiple data types, such as hierarchical data, documents, graphs, and key-value pairs.


Diving into our topic, graph databases are databases where data is represented in nodes and their relations are represented as edges.In traditional databases, data is stored as tables and joins, whereas in graph databases, the data is stored in the form of graphs.
